Domains
--------------
<li>Domains are high-level containers for projects, users and groups. </li>
<li>can be used to centrally manage all keystone-based identity components.</li>
<li> <pre> With the introduction of account domains, server, storage and other resources can 
           now be logically grouped into multiple projects (previously called tenants) 
           which can themselves be grouped under a master account-like container. <pre> </li>
<li>multiple users can be managed within an account domain and assigned roles that vary for each project.</li>
