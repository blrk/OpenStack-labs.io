Glance
--------------
<li>provides a service where users can upload and discover data assets that are meant to be used with other services</li>
<li>currently includes images and metadata definitions</li>

Images
-------------
<li>Glance image services include discovering, registering, and retrieving virtual machine (VM) images</li>
<li>Glance has a RESTful API that allows querying of VM image metadata as well as retrieval of the actual image</li>

<b>Possible places to store VM images</b>
<li>simple filesystems</li>
<li>object-storage systems like the OpenStack Swift project</li>

Metadata Definitions
------------------------
<li>Glance hosts a metadefs catalog</li>
<li>provides a way to programmatically determine various metadata key names and valid values that can be applied to OpenStack resources</li>

Image Service Overview
-------------------------
<li>A number of periodic processes run on the OpenStack Image service to support caching</li>
<li>Replication services ensure consistency and availability through the cluster</li>
<li>Other periodic processes include auditors, updaters, and reapers</li>

<b>OpenStack Image service includes the following components</b>
<li><b>glance-api:</b>Accepts Image API calls for image discovery, retrieval, and storage</li>
<li><b>glance-registry:</b>Stores, processes, and retrieves metadata about images. Metadata includes items such as size and type</li>
<li><b>Database:</b>Stores image metadata and you can choose your database depending on your preference. Most deployments use MySQL or SQLite</li>
<li><b>Storage repository for image files:</b>Various repository types are supported</li>
  <ul>
    <li>normal file systems (or any filesystem mounted on the glance-api controller node)</li>
    <li>Object Storage, RADOS block devices, VMware datastore, and HTTP</li>
    <li>Note that some repositories will only support read-only usage</li>
  </ul>
<li><b>Metadata definition service:</b>A common API for vendors, admins, services, and users to meaningfully define their own custom metadata</li> 
  <ul>
    <li>This metadata can be used on different types of resources like images, artifacts, volumes, flavors, and aggregates</li>
    <li>A definition includes the new propertyâ€™s key, description, constraints, and the resource types which it can be associated with</li>
  </ul>
  
Design Principles
-----------------
<b>all OpenStack projects, is written with the following design guidelines in mind</b>
<li>Component based architecture: Quickly add new behaviors</li>
<li>Highly available: Scale to very serious workloads</li>
<li>Fault tolerant: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures</li>
<li>Recoverable: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify</li>
<li>Open standards: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api</li>
